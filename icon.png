# Icon placeholder - you'll need to replace this with an actual PNG icon
# For now, this is just a text file indicating where the icon should go.
#
# The icon should be:
# - PNG format
# - 512x512 pixels
# - Named "icon.png"
# - Coffee-related imagery (coffee cup, machine, beans, etc.)
#
# You can create one using:
# - Any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
# - Online icon generators
# - Free icon libraries (FontAwesome, Material Icons, etc.)
# - AI image generators
